The Kolkata People’s Film Festival (KPFF), organised by the People's Film Collective (PFC), is a people-supported, independent, volunteer-led cinema festival, showcasing politically committed contemporary documentary and fiction cinema from India and Southasia. It brings together a wide cross-section of audience and filmmakers to interact and form friendships and active camaraderie over films and conversations.

The ninth edition of KPFF will screen 39 films featuring a wide range of compelling stories from India and the subcontinent. It is the worst of times as the Fascist regime in India mounts an unrelenting assault on the working class and religious minorities. As people of entire regions are coerced into silence, entire communities are othered and millions of Bengali-speaking people in Assam have their citizenship hanging from a thread. It is a time of censorship of political art, literature and cinema and erasure of history by the Fascist regime. It is a time when human rights activists and journalists across the country are being punished for siding with the people by long periods of incarceration without trial. It is also the best of times, as oppressed people fight back against state violence. As filmmakers take to the streets to make cinema on our wounded times.

The KPFF 2023 features 9 films that tell stories from the Southasian regions of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Southasian diaspora in British Columbia. Common threads of migration, migrant worker lives, organising for dignity and survival, ordinary people's resilience, resistance and solidarity in times of strife, conflict and despair bind these stories together with those from India.

Emerging from the shadows of a cruel, mismanaged pandemic, KPFF returned in 2022 with its eighth edition; and this time around, we are back to our regular January-calendar. As we move back to collective living as we knew it, KPFF 2023 is imagined as a space for renewed conversations between everyone committed to putting up cultural and political resistance against an emboldened Fascist state, and for celebrating people's power.

We welcome you to KPFF 2023, a film festival of counterculture, resistance, re-imaginings, celebration, and togetherness.
